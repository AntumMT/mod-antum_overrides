-- ** castle_weapons **

-- Recipe for 'throwing:arrow' conflicts with 'castle_weapons:crossbow_bolt'
-- TODO: 'antum:feather' item should be moved to 'antum_items' mod
if antum.dependsSatisfied({'throwing', 'antum'}) then
	-- TODO: Possible alternate solutions:
	--   * Allow 'throwing:arrow' to be used as ammo for 'castle_weapons:crossbow'
	
	-- FIXME: Cannot use 'antum.overrideCraftOutput' because 'core.clear_craft' does not allow
	--        clearing craft by output with quantity. E.g., 'castle_weapons:crossbow_bolt 6'.
	--  - Solution 1: Parse whitespace in 'output'
	antum.clearCraftOutput('castle_weapons:crossbow_bolt')
	
	-- New recipe
	antum.registerCraft({
		output = 'castle_weapons:crossbow_bolt 6',
		recipe = {
			{'antum:feather', 'default:stick', 'default:steel_ingot'},
		},
	})
	
	-- Same recipe but reversed
	antum.registerCraft({
		output = 'castle_weapons:crossbow_bolt 6',
		recipe = {
			{'default:steel_ingot', 'default:stick', 'antum:feather'},
		},
	})
